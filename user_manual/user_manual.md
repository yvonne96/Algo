## Installation Guide

### Step 1

If node and npm are not currently installed on your system please see the following https://www.npmjs.com/package/v5/tutorial to install the most up to date version. If node and npm are already installed you can move to step 2.

### Step 2

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/godwinc3/2018-CA326-cgodwin-algo3.git
$ cd 2018-CA326-cgodwin-algo3/code
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Step 3 

The website will now be visible at https://localhost:3000

## Navigating Website
