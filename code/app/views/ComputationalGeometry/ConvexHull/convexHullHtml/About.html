<h1><b>Convex Hull</b></h1>
<br/>
<p>The Convex Hull of a set of points <i>(Y)</i> in a certain space <i>(S)</i>,
    is the smallest subset of <i>S</i> that contains Y. In other words,
    it's like enclosing a rubber band around Y and the shape that it makes is the convex hull.
    <br/>
    <br/>There are many different algorithms that implement a convex hull for example Chan's algorithm
    , Graham scan, Quickhull etc. In our animation we will be using the monotone chain convex Hull
    algorithm. Monotone chain constructs the convex hull in 2D space.It does this by sorting the points
    by the x co-ordinate (if both points have the same x coordinate, it sorts by the y coordinate) and
    then it constructs lower and upper hulls. Upper hull,in our animation, is the path from the leftmost point to the
    rightmost point in clockwise order. Lower hull is the remaining path in the convex hull.
