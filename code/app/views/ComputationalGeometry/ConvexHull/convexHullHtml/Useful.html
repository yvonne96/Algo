<h2>When is Convex Hull useful?</h2>
<p>
    One application of convex hull that is used in real life is to "relax" a non-convex problem.
    So in other words we are trying to find the closest representation of a convex problem to a non complex
    problem which your are trying to solve. This is handy as if you had many points with loads of minima
    and then construct a relaxation of these points using local and global minima, your convex surface
    will contain the true global maxima.
