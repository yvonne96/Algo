<h1><b>Divide & Conquer Home</b></h1>
<br/>
<p>A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or
    more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.
    The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.</p>
