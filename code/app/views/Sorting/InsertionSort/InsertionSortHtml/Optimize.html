<h2>Optimizing Insertion Sort</h2>
<p>Insertion sort is implemented as follows.</p>
<code><pre>i ‚Üê 1
def insertion_sort(l):
	for i in range(len(l)):
		to_place = l[i]
		pos = i - 1
		while 0 <= pos and l[pos] > to_place:
			l[pos + 1] = l[pos]
			pos -= 1
		l[pos + 1] = to_place
	return l</pre></code>
<p>
    <i>i</i> starts at 1 since it would be redundant to include 0. All elements from <i>i+1</i> are
    already sorted.
