<h2>Usefulness</h2>
<p>
    Like Bubble Sort, Insertion sort is the algorithm of choice either when the data is nearly sorted
    or when the problem size is small since it has low overhead. Insertion sort is adaptive and bubble sort
    isn't so Insertion sort is preferred.

<p>
    Therefore insertion sort is often used as the recursive base case, when you have a small problem size,
    for higher overhead divide-and-conquer sorting algorithms like merge sort and quick sort.
