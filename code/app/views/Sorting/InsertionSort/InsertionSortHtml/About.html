<h1>Insertion Sort</h1>
<br/>
<p>Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list)
    one item at a time. Insertion sort maintains a smaller sorted sublist <i>(sorted)</i>
    of the original list <i>(lst)</i>. The next element of <i>lst</i> is then sloted into the correct
    position of <i>sorted</i> so that it remains sorted.
