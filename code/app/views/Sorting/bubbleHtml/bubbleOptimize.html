<h2>Optimizing Bubble Sort</h2>
<code>
    <pre>procedure bubbleSort( A : list of sortable items )
        n = length(A)
        repeat
            swapped = false
            for i = 1 to n-1 inclusive do
                /* if this pair is out of order */
                if A[i-1] > A[i] then
                    /*swap them and remember something changed*/
                    swap( A[i-1], A[i] )
                    swapped = true
                end if
            end for
        until not swapped
    end procedure</pre>

<p>The bubble sort algorithm can be easily optimized by observing that the n-th pass finds the n-th largest element and puts it into its final place.
    So, the inner loop can avoid looking at the last n âˆ’ 1 items when running for the n-th time</p>
<code>
<pre>procedure bubbleSort( A : list of sortable items )
        n = length(A)
        repeat
            swapped = false
            for i = 1 to n-1 inclusive do
                if A[i-1] > A[i] then
                    swap(A[i-1], A[i])
                    swapped = true
                end if
            end for
            n = n - 1
        until not swapped
    end procedure</pre>
</code>
<p>More generally, it can happen that more than one element is placed in their final position on a single pass.
    In particular, after every pass, all elements after the last swap are sorted, and do not need to be checked again. This allows us to skip over a lot of the elements, resulting in about a worst case 50% improvement in comparison count (though no improvement in swap counts),
    and adds very little complexity because the new code subsumes the "swapped" variable:</p>
<code>
<pre>procedure bubbleSort( A : list of sortable items )
        n = length(A)
        repeat
            newn = 0
            for i = 1 to n-1 inclusive do
                if A[i-1] > A[i] then
                    swap(A[i-1], A[i])
                    newn = i
                end if
            end for
            n = newn
        until n = 0
    end procedure</pre>
