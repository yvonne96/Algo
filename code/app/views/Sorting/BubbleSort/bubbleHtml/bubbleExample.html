<h2>Step by Step Example</h2>
<p>Let us take the array of numbers "5 1 4 2 8",
    and sort the array from lowest number to greatest number using bubble sort.
    In each step, elements written in bold are being compared.
    Three passes will be required.</p>
<p><b>First Pass:</b></p>
<p>( 5 1 4 2 8 ) -> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ),
    Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.</p>
<p>( 1 5 4 2 8 ) -> ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4</p>
<p>( 1 4 5 2 8 ) -> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2</p>
<p>( 1 4 2 5 8 ) -> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ),
    Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5),
    algorithm does not swap them.</p>
<p>( 1 4 2 5 8 ) -> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ),
    Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.</p>
<p><b>Second Pass:</b></p>
<p>( 1 4 2 5 8 ) ->  ( 1 4 2 5 8 )</p>
<p>( 1 4 2 5 8 ) ->  ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2</p>
<p>(1 2 4 5 8 ) ->  ( 1 2 4 5 8 )</p>
<p>Now, the array is already sorted, but the algorithm does not know if it is completed.
    The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.
