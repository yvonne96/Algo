<h2>Optimizing Bubble Sort</h2>
<br/>
<p>Take a look at the following python code:</p>
<code>
    <pre>
    def bubble_sort(l):
	swapped = True
	while swapped:
		swapped = False
		for i in range(len(l) - 1):
			if l[i] > l[i+1]:
				l[i], l[i+1] = l[i+1], l[i]
				swapped = True
	return l</pre>
</code>
<p>
    When you get to the end of the array, there is no need to look at the last element as it is
    in the correct position for that pass.
