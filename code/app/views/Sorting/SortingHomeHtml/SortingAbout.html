<h1><b>Sorting Home</b></h1>
<br/>
<p>
    Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a certain order. The output must contain all the original
    elements of the input and each element must be no smaller than the previous element.

    Most of these algorithms are very basic and every student in computing should learn these algorithms
    as they provide a stepping stone to more complicated algorithm's.
