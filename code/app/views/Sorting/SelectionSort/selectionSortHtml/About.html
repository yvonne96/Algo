<h1>Selection Sort</h1>
<br/>
<p>Selection sort is an in-place sorting algorithm. It sorts the array by having two variables <i>i</i>
and <i>j</i>. All elements to the left of array[i] are already sorted and everything to the right isn't.
</p>
<p>
For every element <i>(i)</i>, all the elements to right are looked at <i>(j)</i> and if array[j] is
    smaller than the previous minimum value seen <i>(min_found)</i> than that becomes the new <i>min_found</i>.
    Once every element to the right has been looked at array[i] is swapped with <i>min_found</i>.
