<h2>How useful is selection sort?</h2>
<p>Selection sort almost always outperforms some simple algorithms like bubble sort</p>
<p>It's useful when the array is almost sorted and is preferred to bubble sort since it has a
    better performance.</p>
<p>It is als preferred when memory writes are more expensive than reads,
as it makes only O(n) writes</p>
