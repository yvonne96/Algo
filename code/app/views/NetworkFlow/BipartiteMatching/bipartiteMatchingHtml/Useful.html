<h2>When is it useful?</h2>
<p>There are many scenarios when a bipartite matching would be useful. For example say we have a group
of people who are applying for a job. Each applicant has applied for many jobs and each job requires
different skills which only certain applicants have. A maximum matching algorithm would help match the
applicants with the jobs so that the maximum number of jobs are filled.</p>
